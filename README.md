# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Cyclistic-Case-Study


## Introduction

This case study is based on the Google Data Analytics Capstone Course from Coursera, where I selected the Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study as per Track A to complete the Capstone course towards earning my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I will be discussing on the data compilation and pre-cleaning activities, followed by cleaning, as well as the analysis itself. The tools used in this case study will be SQL (PostgreSQL) and Tableau (Public).


## About Cyclistic

We are given the role of a data analyst at a fictional company - 'Cyclistic', where we work along with other key team members. Cyclistic has a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations in Chicago, Illinois. Cyclistic users are categorised into 2 types: 

1. Casual Riders
2. Annual Members

The company's marketing executives suggest that the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships, and want to convert more casual riders to annual members. Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. The goal is to provide compelling and meaningful data insights supported with professional and clear data visualizations to the executive team, so they can work on the next steps towards their marketing strategy.

In order to answer the business questions, we will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.


## Ask

**Target Question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

**Business Task: To identify the differences between members and casual riders on how they use Cyclistic's bike-share services differently in order to build strategies to convert casual riders to annual members.**
